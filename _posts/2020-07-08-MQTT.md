Today we see lots of connected devices around us like smart lights, smart tv's, temperature sensors, monitoring wind mills etc..,

How all these things work, what's the technology powers them. One of the most used protocol to power them is Message Queue Telemetry Transport inshort **MQTT**

MQTT is a very light weight, open source messaging protocol with the principle idea behind is **Publish/Subscribe** inshort **Pub/Sub**.

> So what is Pub/Sub

Let's say i want to publish my messages related to weather. In mqtt i create a **topic** called *weather/today*. My clients(mobile phones, computers, any systems) who are all interested in getting my messages **subscribe** to the topic.

Once they are subscribed, they will receive all the messages published on the topic, so that's pub/sub.


There are multilevel and single level topic structures which are defined below.

**multilevel** : Its denoted by *#*.  It matches any number of levels in the topic
Example: sports/football/#

It means i receive all the messages which are published on sports/football/laliga, sports/football/epl etc..,

**singlelevel** : Its denoted by *+*. It matches only one level in the topic.

Example: sports/+

It means i receive all the messages which are published on sports/football, sports/cricket etc..,

**MQTT Server**

The MQTT server is a program or device that acts as an intermediary between MQTT clients that publish application messages and MQTT clients that have made subscriptions.
