Automation helps us to make our life easier, when we are trying do the same thing again and again.

To make the process easier there is free tool from Microsoft called **Power Automate**

The use case that i'm tryin to show you is that your team wants to get notified only when they receive an email from the particular sender during important times.


To achieve this we have to authenticate our mail id that we want our emails to be received with the automate service from microsoft [flow][flow-url].

Once we achieve this then we can enter the email address that we are looking for, then we can connect to the various data operation connectors as shown in the figure also we can manipulate the data that we are looking using expressions.

The following steps discusses how can we connect and automate the flow of receiving emails then sharing into the channel

1. Authenticate with gmail 
2. Convert the email that we receive as html to text because we are only interested in the content not the css and html tags
3. Once we convert the content, encode the content for easier parsing
4. Based on examining the content, split the content into arrays using the encoding values
    
      > Example : split(outputs('Compose'),'%0A')

5. Decode the array to get back the proper values
6. This is the important step to pick up which data that you more interested to show up in the message

     > Example : decodeUriComponent(outputs('data')[2])

7. This message will be picked up and sent to the channel that you wanted to share to

Once you test the flow, you will see the result which is useful for determining the data and logic, as mentioned below.

This flow keeps running and monitoring when there is an email from the specified sender and shares into the channel.

Like this we have lots of templates which enables us to automate the task in a most efficient and easiest way.
