Let's say you own a website and wanted to make a Progressive Web App. Now the work to convert a web app into progressive web app has become super simple with the help of [PWABuilder][jekyll-docs].

**1.** Just visit the pwabuilder website, enter the url of the your own website then it analyses and tells you what are the things to be done as shown below

**2.** It generates a manifest file, where we can customise the logos, background color etc..,
then add the generated code to your website

**3.** Once that's done. With the help of service workers, we can add offline capabilities to the progress web app (pwa) where the code is autogenerated based on the capabilities you choose as shown below

**4.** If we want to target multiple platforms like Android, MacOS, Windows that can also be possible with [Build PWA][jekyll-docs2]


With the above mentioned simple steps, you can easily turn your website into a complete pwa.
