The idea of the script is to remove the manual work involved in creating, downloading, resigning and uploading an app to Maas360, a Mobile Device Management solution provided by IBM.

The shell script mentioned below automates the iOS app resigning and uploading to Maas360 in an easy way.

**1.** Create a folder and add the app that needs to be resigned

**2.** Run this script inside the folder to see the magic happens. To run the script type **./resign.sh** in the terminal or command prompt 

**3** What happens in each and every line of the script has been clear indicated for easier understanding
