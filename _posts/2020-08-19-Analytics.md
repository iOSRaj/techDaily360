As a provider of an application, We always wanted to know more about how an application is performing in the market using analytics.

Sometimes analytics comes with high cost when we use New Relic, Dynatrace etc.., to keep the data safe and comply with the security standards of the company / policy.

At the same time we can use free analytics services such as Firebase but it comes with the cost of data being shared to Google.

To avoid data being shared and being paid too much, We have an free open source analytics platform called **Umami** which we can host in our own server and connect to our website or application.

In this way we can have a full control of analytics, saving cost and comply with the policies.
