Manytimes we might come across a scenario where we have to share an address, when we board a taxi, when one of your friend requests. This sometimes can be repetitive, why can't we make it simpler with the set of simple steps using **Shortcuts app** in iOS.

**1.** Tap on **+ Create Shortcut** then **+ Add Action**, search for a street address. Under Actions, street address will be listed. Select it to add to the shorcuts

**2.** In the street address section, fill in the address

**3.** After entering the address, Tap **+** then type **url** in the search bar. Under Actions, URL will be listed. Select it to add to the shorcuts

**4.** Type the following **comgooglemaps://?daddr=Street Address**. As suggestions will be shown on the keyboard tool bar for StreetAddress. Tap to add it

**5.** Tap **+** then type **Generate QR Code** in the search bar. Under Actions, Generate QR will be listed. Select it to add to the shorcuts

**6.** After make sure, it has mentioned as ***Generate QR code from URL***

**7.** Final Step is Tap **+** then type **Quick Look** in the search bar. Under Actions, Quick Look will be listed. Select it to add to the shorcuts. Make sure it has mentioned as ***Show QRCode*** in Quick look

**8.** Run â–¶ the shortcut to see the **QR Code**

Scan it with another Mobile device to see it works :)
