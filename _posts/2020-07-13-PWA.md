Let's say you own a website and wanted to make a Progressive Web App. Now the work to convert a web app into progressive web app has become super simple with the help of [PWABuilder][jekyll-docs].

**1.** Just visit the pwabuilder website, enter the url of the your own website then it analyses and tells you what are things to be done as shown below

**2.** It generates a manifest file, where we can customise the logo's, background color etc..,
then add the generated code to your website

**3.** Once thats, done. With the help of service workers, we can add offline capabilities to the progress web app (pwa) where the code is autogenerated based on the capabilities you choose as shown below

With the above mentioned simple steps, you can turn your website into a complete pwa.
