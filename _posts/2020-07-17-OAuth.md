Main Purpose of an OAuth is to provide secure and delegated access to the users

![OAUTH](/files/images/oauth.png)

Important players in OAuth are **Resource Owner, Authorization Server, Access Token and Resource Server**

> Let's see how it works

**1.** Application A request user(**Resource Owner**) rights to access his profile, age, image etc.., via Application B

**2.** Application B request user credentials from user (**Resource Owner**)

**3.** User enters his/her credentials

**4.** Application B's **Authorization Server** validates the **grant** permission requested by Application A to access the user's information such as profile, age etc..,

**5.** Application B's **Authorization Server** sent the info(**Access Token**) back to Application A

**6.** Application A uses the **Access Token** to communicate with Application B rather than asking for the user

**7.** Application A request user's information from **Resource Server** using the **Access Token**

**8.** **Resource Server** validates the **Access Token** with **Authorization server** and then provides the requested resource like profile, age, image etc..,
