It can be useful to compare ec2 instances across different regions to save some money.

This can be easily done by selecting the regions and see how an instance type performs and costs.

There is a nice curl command can be used to perform this

{% highlight shell %}
 curl 'https://ec2.shop?region=us-west-2'

 //To Filter 
 curl 'https://ec2.shop?region=us-west-2&filter=m4,m5,ssd'
{% endhighlight %}
